\title{Construct a Matern-based Smooth Term with Fixed and Random Effects}
\usage{
\method{smooth.construct}{AMatern.smooth.spec}(object, data, knots)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{A smooth specification object created by `s()`, containing user-defined smoothing parameters.}

\item{data}{A data frame containing the covariate for the smooth term.}

\item{knots}{A list of knots supplied by the user or automatically generated from `x`.}
}
\value{
A smooth term object of class `"AMatern.smooth"`, `"mgcv.smooth"`, containing:
\itemize{
  \item `X`: The final design matrix combining fixed and random effect components.
  \item `S`: The smoothing penalty matrix.
  \item `rank`: The effective rank of the penalty matrix.
  \item `null.space.dim`: The dimension of the fixed effect (null space).
  \item `null.project`: Projection matrix onto the null space.
  \item `smoothfun`: The function used to generate the Matern basis.
  \item `kappa_matern`: The selected quantiles used as knots for Matern splines.
  \item `lambda_matern`: The scale parameter for the Matern spline.
}
}
\description{
This function constructs a smooth term based on Matern splines, incorporating both fixed and random effects.
The fixed effects structure is user-defined via `getA`, which is stored in `xt$getA`, while the second
element of `xt` (i.e., `xt$para`) contains the corresponding parameters for `getA`. Users can customize
the fixed effect structure, but the associated parameters must be provided as a list, ensuring that the
function only has `x` (data) and `para` as inputs.

The final smooth term dimension (`k`) includes both the fixed effect (null space) dimension and the
random effect dimension. The `m` parameter allows two values: the number of knots (`nk`) for generating
the Matern spline (which is always based on quantiles of `x`), and the scale parameter used for the
Matern spline construction. The resulting Matern spline undergoes PCA, extracting the top principal
components, ensuring that the number of retained PCs is `k - fixed effect dimension`.

This function constructs a smooth term using a Matern spline approach. The fixed effect structure is
defined through `getA(x, para)`, which is extracted from `xt$getA` and takes two inputs: `x` (data) and
`para` (a list of parameters). The number of knots (`nk`) is determined based on quantiles of `x`. The
smoothing term undergoes PCA, extracting the top components such that the number of retained principal
components equals `k - fixed effect dimension`.

The function returns a smooth term object containing the final design matrix, penalty matrix, and
additional metadata such as the selected Matern quantiles and scale parameters.
