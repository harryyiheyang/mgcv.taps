\title{Generate a polynomial basis matrix}
\usage{
polynomial(x, para)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A numeric vector representing the covariate values at which to evaluate the polynomial basis.}

\item{order}{A non-negative integer specifying the highest polynomial order to include in the basis matrix.}
}
\value{
A numeric matrix with `length(x)` rows and `order + 1` columns.
        The first column corresponds to the intercept (constant term, `x^0 = 1`),
        the second column to `x^1`, and so on up to `x^order`.
}
\description{
This function constructs a polynomial basis matrix for a given covariate `x` up to a specified order.
The resulting matrix includes columns for each power of `x` from 0 (intercept) to the specified polynomial order.
}
\examples{
x <- seq(-1, 1, length.out = 10)
polynomial(x, para = 3)

}
