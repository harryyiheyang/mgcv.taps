Description: TAPS (Test for Arbitrary Parametric Structure) is a novel estimation and hypothesis testing methodology designed to assess whether a parametric structure can sufficiently describe a target function in a generalized additive model. This package implements the decomposition of the target function into an "A + B" structure, where A represents the basis matrix of the parametric structure to be tested, and B is the basis matrix of splines adaptively orthogonal to A. The R package mgcv can recognize the novel splines constructed by this package.
